# MINFLUX_NPC_Tracking
The codes are specifically tailored for analyzing two-color data obtained through 3D-MINFLUX. The first color corresponds to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), while the second color represents the 3D tracks of cargo moving through the NPC. For detailed information about the scripts, please consult "Code_Description.pdf". This document offers a thorough explanation of the script order.
## System Requirements
The analysis requires MATLAB software to run the codes.
MATLAB>R2021b with Add-On:
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
1. Signal Processing Toolbox
2. Optimization Toolbox
3. Mapping Toolbox
4. Image Processing Toolbox
5. Curve Fitting Toolbox
Any standard computer with sufficient RAM to meet MATLAB's requirements can be used for this purpose. The analysis was conducted using MATLAB R2021b on Windows 11 Home version 10.0.22631.

## Installation Guide
MATLAB software can be installed from [mathworks website](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html). A typical installation time is ~15-30 min.

## Demo
Sample data has been uploaded on Github. Please refer to "Model NPC Scaffold Data.txt" and "Model Track Data.txt". Detailed explanation on output files has been described in "Code_Description.pdf".  

## Instructions for use
