# MINFLUX_NPC_Tracking
The codes are specifically tailored for analyzing two-color data obtained through 3D-MINFLUX. The first color corresponds to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), while the second color represents the 3D tracks of cargo moving through the NPC. For detailed information about the scripts, please consult "Code_Description.pdf". This document offers a thorough explanation of the script order.
## System Requirements
MATLAB software is required to run the codes. Any standard computer with reasonable RAM that satisfies MATLAB's requirements can be used to run the analysis. All codes were run using MATLAB R2021b on Windows 11 Home ver 10.0.22631
